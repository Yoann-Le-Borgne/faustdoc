## Various Tools

### Syntax Highlighting

#### [Syntax Highlighting Files](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/tree/master-dev/syntax-highlighting)

This folder contains syntax highlighting files for various editors.

#### [Sublime Text syntax](https://github.com/nuchi/faust-sublime-syntax)

Sublime Text syntax file for the Faust programming language.

#### [Faust-Mode](https://github.com/rukano/emacs-faust-mode)

Major Emacs mode for the Faust programming language, featuring syntax highlighting, automatic indentation and auto-completion.

#### [Faustine](https://github.com/emacsmirror/faustine)

Faustine allows the edition of Faust code using emacs.

#### [faust neovim plugin](https://github.com/madskjeldgaard/faust-nvim)

Plugin to edit Faust code in the hyperextensible Vim-based text editor [neowim](http://neovim.io).
 
### Code Generators
 
#### [faust2pdex](https://github.com/jujudusud/BPD/tree/master/tools/faust2pdex)
 
 Generator of Faust wrappers for Pure Data. This software wraps the C++ code generated by Faust into a native external for Pure Data. You obtain a piece of source code that you can use with pd-lib-builder to produce a native binary with the help of make. No knowledge of C++ programming is required.

#### [Faust.quark](https://github.com/madskjeldgaard/faust.quark)

This SuperCollider package makes it possible to create SuperCollider packages (Quarks) containing plugins written in Faust code. With this, you can distribute plugins written in Faust and make it easy for others to install, compile or uninstall them. It also contains some simple interfaces for the `faust` and `faust2sc.py` commands used behind the scenes.

#### [ode2dsp](https://git.sr.ht/~kdsch/ode2dsp)

[ode2dsp](https://git.sr.ht/~kdsch/ode2dsp) is a Python library for generating ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers in digital signal processing (DSP) languages. It automates the tedious and error-prone symbolic calculations involved in creating a DSP model of an ODE.

Features:

- Support linear and nonlinear systems of ODEs
- Support trapezoidal and backward Euler discrete-time integral approximations
- Approximate solutions of implicit equations using Newton's method
- Render finite difference equations (FDEs) to Faust code
- Calculate stability of ODEs and FDEs at an operating point
